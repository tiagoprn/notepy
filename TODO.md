## NEXT
- most recent backup of the dokuwiki database, already cleaned up, is at
  docker/postgres/shared (notepy.c.backup). 
- create dockerized deploys and test them locally:
    - script to build a docker image (example at
      /storage/temp/storage/backups/20180804.2001.20 - sif)
    - use traefik to route traffic to the container (user self-signed
      certificates locally) 

## FUTURE (MEDIUM-LONG TERM)  
- REST API using django-rest-framework
- add tests
